# To-Do List App

## Description
This is a simple and responsive To-Do List app that allows users to add, search, and remove tasks. The app is designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. It uses modern web dev tools and frameworks to create a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the app.
- **[Tailwindcss](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/)**: Tailwind CSS was used for styling the app, providing classes for a modern and responsive design.
- **[Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/)**: Flowbite components used to enhance the UI with pre-designed elements like buttons and cards.
- **JavaScript**: Used to handle the app's functionality, including adding, removing, and searching tasks.
- **LocalStorage**: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence even after the page is refreshed.

## My Process
1. **Planning**: I started by outlining the core features of the app, such as adding tasks, displaying them, and allowing users to remove or search for tasks.
2. **Building the UI**: I used Tailwind CSS and Flowbite to create a clean and modern interface. This included designing the input fields, buttons, and task list layout.
3. **Functionality**: I wrote JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as adding tasks to the list, saving them to local storage, and dynamically updating the UI.
4. **Testing and Debugging**: I tested the app across different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and fixed any bugs I encountered during development.

## What I Learned
As a junior developer, this project taught me:
- How to use **Tailwind CSS** and **Flowbite** to quickly build modern and responsive UIs.
- The importance of **local storage** for persisting data in small-scale applications.
- How to dynamically manipulate the DOM using **JavaScript** to create interactive features.
- The value of planning and breaking down tasks into smaller steps to manage the development process effectively.
- Debugging and testing are crucial to ensure the app works as expected across different platforms.

This project was a great learning experience, and I look forward to building more complex applications as I continue to grow as a developer.
